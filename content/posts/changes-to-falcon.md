Don't use general ancestries like "orcs" and "half-orcs", instead use their factions: Icespire Clan (orcs) and Talos Worshipers (half-orcs).

Falcon is a member of the Emerald Conclave, and the reason he doesn't like those groups is because they're wrecking havoc and disturbing the balance of Neverwinter Woods.

Instead of orc heads, use broken weapons and armor as trophies, and make them having symbols of their factions.
